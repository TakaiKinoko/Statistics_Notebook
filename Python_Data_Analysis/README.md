Here are my notes on Allen B. Downey's *Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers*. 
This book gives an introductory explanation on these common statistical approaches below with the help of Python:

* descriptive statistics
* exploratory data analysis
* hypothesis testing
* estimation

## /src folder
* 002FemResp.dat -- respondent file which contains one line for each of the 7,643 female respondents
* 2002FemPreg.dat -- contains one line for each pregnancy reported by a respondent
* survey.py is the code used to process the data
