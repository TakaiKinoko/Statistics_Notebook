# Terms
* **cross-sectional** study v.s. **longitudinal study**
    * cross-sectional study captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time. 
        * In general, cross-sectional studies are meant to be representative, which means that every member of the target popu- lation has an equal chance of participatin
    * longitudinal study, which observes a group repeatedly over a period of time
* **population**
    * surveys draw conclusions about a population
    * The people who participate in a survey are called **respondents**; a group of respondents is called a **cohort**
    
* **oversampling**
    * e.g. deliberately recruit three groups—Hispanics, African-Americans and teenagers— at rates higher than their representation in the U.S. population. The reason for oversampling is to make sure that the number of respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw valid statistical inferences.
    * the drawback of oversampling is that it is not as easy to draw conclusions about the general population based on statistics from the survey. 

# Database Terms
* **record**: information about one respondent
* **fields**: variables that make up a record
* **table**: a collection of records
