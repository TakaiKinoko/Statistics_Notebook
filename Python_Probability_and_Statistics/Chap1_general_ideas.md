## Why anecdata (anecdotal evidence) normally fail?
* small number of observations
* selection bias
* confirmation bias 
* inaccuracy

## a statistical approach
* data collection 
* descriptive statistics
* exploratory data analysis
* hypothesis testing
* estimation

# Terms
* **cross-sectional** study v.s. **longitudinal study**
    * cross-sectional study captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time. 
        * In general, cross-sectional studies are meant to be representative, which means that every member of the target popu- lation has an equal chance of participatin
    * longitudinal study, which observes a group repeatedly over a period of time
* **population**
    * surveys draw conclusions about a population
    * The people who participate in a survey are called **respondents**; a group of respondents is called a **cohort**
    
* **oversampling**
    * e.g. deliberately recruit three groups—Hispanics, African-Americans and teenagers— at rates higher than their representation in the U.S. population. The reason for oversampling is to make sure that the number of respondents in each of these groups is large enough to draw valid statistical inferences.
    * the drawback of oversampling is that it is not as easy to draw conclusions about the general population based on statistics from the survey. 

# Database Terms
* **record**: information about one respondent
* **fields**: variables that make up a record
* **table**: a collection of records


## statistical significance
Even when an **apparent effect** is derived from some data, there's still no guarantee that the effect is statistically significant.
    * need to see other **summary statistics**, e.g. with a difference in  means, what about median and variance
    * is it possible that the difference occurred by chance?
    * Is it possible that the apparent effect is due to selection bias or some other error in the experimental setup? If so, then we might conclude that the effect is an **artifact**; that is, something we created (by accident) rather than found.
